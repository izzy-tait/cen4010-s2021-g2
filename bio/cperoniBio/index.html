                    <p>Hello! My name is Craig Peroni and I’m a current Computer Science student at Florida Atlantic University. I also have a prior B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Florida State University, which I received in 2012. </p>

                    <p>I love electrical engineering, or really anything that makes me think, but software engineering has been a passion of mine since I was young. I find programming to be a lot less restrictive than EE, and as a result it lets me be more
                        creative while still being technically minded at the same time.</p>

                    <p>I’ve had a lot of hobbies and passions in my life. I used to play drums in a heavy metal band while also playing percussion in an orchestra. I was extremely into electronics and computers growing up, while I also trained in Track &
                        Field until I was nationally ranked. I like to relax by laying on a dock in the sun and reading a book, or by downhill mountain biking. These days one of my biggest passions is animals and I recently raised 26 chickens from eggs.</p>

                    <p> I tend to enjoy a little bit of everything in life, including buying GME stock. As a wise man once said, “Ape together strong.”</p>
